while loop concept explanation
	- what is a loop (groundhog day)
	- watch the movie groundHog day for a visual understanding

	- when we want to repeat something
	- use google search 'what is a loop in programming' keyword sequence(i.e - meaning plural, not singular)



similarities between while loops & conditions
	-both are conditioned based meaning it must be true or false

and therefore, depending on the input an specific outcome will be achieved, meaning it is an engineered outcome
meaning if we want it to do a variety of options

we use while loops and conditions with booleans


difference btw while loops and conditionals
-it doesn't stop UNTIL the condition is achieved

Philisophical explanation 

in another sense, when you don't learn your lesson
	-can be about personal life mistakes
	-can be in your studies
	-can be in your social relationships like friends
	-can even be when you take the wrong bus or the wrong route
	-or when you know your smartphone battery will only last you 3 hours and you decide to keep procrastinating getting a portable battery maybe cos u were waiting for your parents to give you allowance to buy it when you could've signed up for that 3 day part time work event and get it yourself

it will keep repeating itself over and over and you will keep getting the same unpleasant outcome

and only when the condition state becomes False
-it stops repeating

same thing, when you stop making the same mistakes, 

however, as your instructor who likes to apply his work into all areas of life, if you keep doing the same thing that allows you to achieve success repeatedly

keep doing that
-like for example, waking up early, planning ahead, giving full concentration in class

now that's something worth repeating


conditions only happens 1 time



which is more effective?

-no right or wrong answer because this is circumstantial
depending on what are the requirements of your programme

if you need something to repeat itself without a set limit like our password prompter
-while loops

but when it comes to checking multiple conditions
	-we can't keep running no limit things like our calculator operation

and so and if condition will be better here

-think of it as a light switch analogy

if lets say every time you leave the house and your parents requested for you to turn off all the lights so that no electricity is wasted while no one is using

and, being privileged singaporeans, we keep forgetting what they say we will do

they can implement a program to continuously lock the door, even when you have the key to unlock it

until the condition, all lights in the house are turned off

then do the condition becomes false

after the lesson today, if you play around with your light switch you will notice, it only goes 2 ways
and off, will be that the lights are in false states i.e no lights
lights on, will be true
there are lights


[review]

similarities - both are condition based
difference   - loops are used only when you want something to happen multiple times, conditons only when you want it to happen once

for loop, when you run multiple values in a sequential order, meaning. it has an ending
like p1-p6, s1-s4
or a todo list
